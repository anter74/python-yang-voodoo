= Plant UML

This shows an example of taking a given yang schema, expanding with a given data tree
to provide a JSON which could be processed by PlantUML.

[IMPORTANT]
====
There appears to be constraints with PlantUML processing JSON which is too large, but this
works for small outputs. This may be simple memory constraints that can be tuned with extending
the Heap size.

Further analysis may suggest it's not the size but the use of the intermediate nodes representing
list-> list elements.
====

The basic plantuml json processor takes in a file that `Diagram.py` would produce.

----
@startjson
{
"bob":1
}
@endjson
----

This then can be processed via plantuml to provide an output PNG `examples/plantuml/uml.png`
