= HTML Forms

This is merely a proof of concept which shows the challenge of providing a UI which 
requires the ability to show the user the data that is real, but also the possibilities
of data that may be created.

i.e. the schema must be expanded with a given data tree.

This is not a functioning web-page as there is no back-end server holding a session for
a user, no interaction to implement the `+` button or `-` button of a list - but this does
show the heavy lifting that is needed.
